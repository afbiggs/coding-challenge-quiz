# coding-challenge-quiz

This application is a basic multiple choice quiz aimed at helping people understand the basics of css, html, and javascript. 

For each question, there are 4 options to choose from. There is a hover color of light red to signify the option the user is currently over, and upon clicking the correct option the answer either stays as red or blue (if correctly choosing). Once the corresponding messaging appears for each question, there is a "Next Question" button which will advance to the next question. When the user completes the quiz, there is a "Try Again" button. This will bring the user back to the start of the quiz and will prompt a restart of the timer. Should the user decide to view high scores from the session, by clicking on the "View High Scores" button, high scores can be viewed. The option to try again is still presented, as is the clear scores option.
